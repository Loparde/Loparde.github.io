                        Strife of Life is a game about the creative minds of our childhood and the fight against our daily tasks.
                        As children, many of us likely thought about a triangle ruler as a pistol or made slingshot with it by attaching rubber bands to the corners.
                        This game takes the struggles of every day life and turns them into a playful fight. Visualizing the fight we keep up all the time, using whatever is around us.

                    <p1>We developed this game within our 3rd semester in a group of three. </p1>

                    <p1>The core idea of the game came from a friend of mine and I took it and developed it further (I asked him for permission, don't worry). </p1>
                    <br />
                    <p1>
                        During the project, my job was to coordinate, design and code the inventory with the crafting system.
                        The rooms need to be distributed equally since there are different classes, with different rooms they can access.
                        No class is supposed to be superior, instead they have different options, stengths and weaknesses.
                    </p1>
                    <br />
                    <p1>
                        The crafting system was fun to create, as a foundation I had to make an inventory that is flexible, accessible and is correctly displayed.
                        After that was done, the crafting itself needed to check up availabilities with the inventory and remove or add items.
                        To make that process editable easily, I used presets that defined what kind and how many items one needed to craft an item.

                        Sadly, my whole idea was way too ambitious for a project in the thrid semester. The mindmap is gigantic and my passion for this game is burning.
